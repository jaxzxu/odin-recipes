    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This is a true struggle meal for anyone who wants flavor and substance on a budget. In fact, the meat is optional. You can also just use the cheapest cut of meat you can find out there. Regardless, rice is probably one of the cheapest starch sources out there and this will be cheaper than any meal you can possibly buy out there. Enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>rice</li>
        <li>pork belly</li>
        <li>egg</li>
        <li>soy sauce</li>
        <li>chinese vinegar</li>
        <li>lao gan ma</li>
        <li>scallions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash rice to remove starch for better taste. Put in rice cooker.</li>
        <li>Mise en place. Chop up scallions and prep ingredients for assembly.</li>
        <li>Fry the pork belly. You can choose to cut it into smaller pieces before, after, or during the cooking process. We just need to render the fat out. You can make it as cripsy or soft as you'd like.</li>
        <li>Set pork aside and dump out excess oil.</li>
        <li>Bring a pan to high heat with the pork fat. When smoking, put in your egg(s). You can immediately turn off the heat and put on a lid. This will fry the egg from the bottom and steam it from the top. It will give you a crispy egg white and smoothy egg yolk that rivals that of an poached egg.</li>
        <li>Put rice in a bowl and top with the fried egg. Add your scallions and pork belly. Season to taste with lao gan ma, soy sauce, and chinese vinegar. (I use 1 tbsp of lao gan ma. For soy sauce and vinegar, ratio is more important than amount. I like a 3:1 ratio of soy sauce to vinegar. Adjust according to your tastes)</li>
        <li>Mix and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
