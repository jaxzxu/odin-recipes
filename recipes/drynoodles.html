    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This is more of an technique than a recipe. This is just noodles with a sauce instead of a broth. Hence the name, <em>dry noodles</em>. I've been experimenting with a way to get the bounciness of cold noodles while still eating the noodles hot. I will share below.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>any noodles of your choosing</li>
        <li>sauce</li>
        <li>vegetables</li>
        <li>garnish</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil. Add the noodles and cooked to your perferred doneness. Test by eating a few strands.</li>
        <li>Save the cooking water. Take the noodles out and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Blanch vegetables of your choosing in the hot cooking water. Strain and place in bowl.</li>
        <li>Put a sauce of your choosing in the bowl. Get creative. You can use lao gan ma and butter. Or use seaseme oil, crushed seaseme seeds, garlic, vinegar, and soy sauce. To be frank, you can just experiment with anything you have in the pantry. Remember, the components which make tasty food: Salt, Heat, Acid, and Fat. Likewise, the Chinese has the flavor profiles or Sour, Sweet, Bitter, Spicy, and Umami.</li>
        <li>Reheat the noodles by putting them in the hot cooking water. Strain and put into the bowl. This step reheats the noodles without further cooking them.</li>
        <li>Mix and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
