    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This is simply the way I've made using ingredients I've had at my disposal. This is by no means the most authentic recipe nor the most flavorful. I will say it gives a great return on investment if the input we consider is time, energy, and effort. This is simple and easy to make while borrowing from Chinese cooking technique (bringing the meat up to a boil in cold water with cooking wine, scallions, and ginger and discarding the impurties for a cleaner taste.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lamb chunks</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Red lentils</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>African spice mix</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Chinese cooking wine</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put lamb or goat chunks in cold water in a pot with ginger, scallions, and chinese cooking wine.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and remove scum and impurities from the top.</li>
        <li>Strain meat and wash under cold water.</li>
        <li>Fry the meat in oil that's been heated with sugar to get color on the meat.</li>
        <li>Once the meat has color, add in onions to carmelize. Add in spice mix towards the end to bring out the fragrance of the spices.</li>
        <li>Add in tomatoes and soy sauce to deglaze the pan.</li>
        <li>Add in lentils and water. Mix and bring up to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once it's boiling, put on a lid and reduce to a simmer for 40+ minutes. The longer you cook it the more flavorul and tender the meat will be.</li>
        <li>Serve with your starch of choice. Rice or bread are fine options.</li>
    </ol>
